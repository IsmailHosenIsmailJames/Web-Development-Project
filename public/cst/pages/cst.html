                Tangail Polytechnic Institute's CST department offers two shifts: Morning Shift and Day Shift. Each shift encompasses semesters from 1st to 8th, with the exception of the 8th semester, which is dedicated to industrial training rather than academic coursework. The semester system follows a pair pattern, meaning that when even semesters are running, all departments are focused on even semesters, and when even semesters are complete, the focus shifts to odd semesters. Each semester accommodates hundreds of students, who are divided into two groups for effective management.
              </p>
